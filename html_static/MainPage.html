         <p> <b>George Raymond Richard Martin</b> (born George Raymond Martin; September 20, 1948), often referred to as GRRM, is
        an American novelist and short story writer in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres, a screenwriter, and
        television producer.  He is best known for A Song of Ice and Fire, his international bestselling series of epic
        fantasy novels that HBO adapted for its dramatic series Game of Thrones. Martin serves as the series' co-executive
        producer, while also scripting four episodes of the series. In 2005, Lev Grossman of Time called Martin "the
        American Tolkien",and the magazine later named him one of the "2011 Time 100," a list of the "most influential
        people in the world."</p>

        <p>George Raymond Martin (he later adopted the confirmation name Richard at the age of 13) was born
        on September 20, 1948, in Bayonne, New Jersey, the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin
        and his wife Margaret Brady Martin. He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Janet. Martin's father
        was half Italian, while his mother was half Irish; his family also contains German, English, and
        French ancestry. The family first lived in a house on Broadway, belonging to Martin's great-grandmother.
        In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks. During Martin's childhood,
        his world consisted predominantly of "First Street to Fifth Street", between his grade school and his
        home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing
        so was through his imagination, so he became a voracious reader. When Martin's family moved to a larger
        apartment after his sister was born, he also had a view of the waters of the Kill van Kull, where freighters
        and oil tankers flying flags from distant countries were entering and leaving Port Newark. He had an encyclopedia
        with a list of flags, and when using it to figure out where the ships came from, he would find himself dreaming
        of traveling to these remote locations. After the sun went down, the lights from Staten Island would shine across
        the water, which in his imagination was Shangri-La and "Shanghai and Paris, Timbuctoo and Kalamazoo, Marsport
        and Trantor, and all the other places that I'd never been and could never hope to go". The young Martin began
        writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included.
        He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their
        toy castle, so he finally decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots". Martin attended
        Mary Jane Donohoe School and then later Marist High School. While there he became an avid comic-book fan,
        developing a strong interest in the innovative superheroes being published by Marvel Comics A letter
        Martin wrote to the editor of Fantastic Four was printed in issue No. 20 (Nov 1963); it was the first of
        many sent, e.g., FF #32, #34, and others from his family's home at 35 E. First Street, Bayonne, NJ. Fans
        who read his letters then wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling
        comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines. In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's Alley
        Award for his prose superhero story "Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier",[citation needed] the first of many
        awards he would go on to win for his fiction. In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in Journalism from Northwestern
        University, Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971,
        also from Northwestern. Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for
        and obtained conscientious-objector status; he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972â€“1974)
        as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation. An expert chess player, he also
        directed chess tournaments for the Continental Chess Association from 1973 to 1976.
        In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction
        convention in Milwaukee. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who confesses that at that time he despised science
        fiction and fantasy) not only to give speculative fiction a second look, but to write in the field himself.
        (Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the Nebula Award for science fiction
        and fantasy. In 1998, he won a Bram Stoker Award for best horror novel.) In turn, Guthridge helped Martin
        find a job at Clarke University (then Clarke College). Martin "wasn't making enough money to stay alive",
        from writing and the chess tournaments, says Guthridge.From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and
        journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.
        While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy, in the fall of 1977,
        made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer.
        He resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, he moved to Santa Fe in 1979.

               Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was
        "The Hero", sold to Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed.
        His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award and Nebula Awards was "With Morning Comes Mistfall",
        published in 1973 in Analog magazine. A member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA),
        Martin became the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979; he served as its vice-president
        from 1996 to 1998. In 1976, for Kansas City's MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon),
        Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers'
        Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers, their friends and families, the evening
        following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards,
        for the novelette "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and the novella The Storms of Windhaven, co-written with
        Lisa Tuttle. The Hugo Losers' Party became an annual Worldcon event thereafter, and its formal title eventually
        changed to something a bit more politically correct as both its size and prestige grew. Although Martin often
        writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined
        future history, known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm". He has also written at least one
        piece of political-military fiction, "Night of the Vampyres", collected in Harry Turtledove's anthology The
        Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century (2001). The unexpected commercial failure of Martin's fourth
        book, The Armageddon Rag (1983), "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time", he recalled.
        However, that failure led him to seek a career in television after a Hollywood option on that novel led-
        to his being hired, first as a staff writer and then as an Executive Story Consultant, for the revival of the
        Twilight Zone. After the CBS series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science
        fiction series Max Headroom. He worked on scripts and created the show's "Ped Xing" character (the president of
        the Zic Zak corporation, Network 23's primary sponsor). Before his scripts could go into production, however, the
        ABC show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was then hired as a writer-producer on the new
        dramatic fantasy series Beauty and the Beast; in 1989 he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14
        of its episodes. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor,
        this time overseeing the development of the multi-author Wild Cards book series, which takes place in a
        shared universe in which a small slice of postâ€“World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release
        of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are still being published in the ongoing series from Tor Books.
        In Second Person Martin "gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that
        gave rise to his Wild Cards shared-world anthologies". An important element in the creation of the
        multiple author series was a campaign of Chaosium's role-playing game Superworld (1983), that Martin ran
        in Albuquerque.[23] Martin's own contributions to Wild Cards have included Thomas Tudbury, "The Great and
        Powerful Turtle", a powerful psychokinetic whose flying "shell" consisted of an armored VW Beetle. As of
        June 2011, 21 Wild Cards volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed
        the contract for the 22nd volume, Low Ball (2014), published by Tor Books. In early 2012, Martin signed
        another Tor contract for the 23rd Wild Cards volume, High Stakes. While he was making a satisfactory
        living in Hollywood, he did not feel fulfilled given that so few of the projects he worked on ever went
        into production; "No amount of money can really take the place of... you want your stuff to be read.
        You want an audience and four guys in an executive office suite at ABC or Columbia is not adequate."
        Martin's novella, Nightflyers (1980), was adapted into an eponymous 1987 feature film; he was unhappy
        about having to cut plot elements for the screenplay's scenario in order to accommodate the film's small budget
